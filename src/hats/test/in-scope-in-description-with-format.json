The core logic is implemented asynchronously which enables swaps to happen independently of each other. This means you can create a pool consisting of many assets on many chains.\n\nCatalyst supports various price curves. Currently a constant product curve is implemented (Volatile) and an amplified curve is implemented (Amplified).\n\nCatalyst uses [Generalised Incentives](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives) to communicate cross-chain.\n\n**Generalised Incentives** is a standardization of incentives between AMBs. This enables applications to easily integrate many AMBs without having to use different incentive schemes or logic flows.\n\n## KYC & AML Disclaimer\nWinners of this competition will need to undergo either a light or a complete KYC process (above $15k prizes) due to Catalyst Foundation legal requirements.

This process will be conducted by the Catalyst Foundation (or a designated third-party service provider). Participants will be required to provide additional identification documentation, which may include but is not limited to a government-issued photo ID, proof of address, wallet address and email address. Participants agree to comply with reasonable requests on KYC and acknowledge and understand that failure to complete the KYC process may result in the forfeiture of the prize.\n \n**Data Use and Privacy Disclaimer**\nBy participating in the Competition, you agree to our collection, use, and sharing of your personal information as described in this disclaimer.
