## Prize distribution and scoring

The prize distribution works as follows:

* Security reviewers will score points for each finding.
* Prizes are distributed proportionally to the number of points scored.
* A High Severity is worth 10 points, and a Medium Severity 3 points.
* Duplicate findings will be resolved using a scoring formula that incentivizes unique findings.
* Duplicate findings will be resolved using the following scoring formula that incentivizes unique findings:  
   * Each duplicate finding will be scaled down by 0.9n−1/n0.9^{n - 1} / n0.9n−1/n, where nnn is the # of duplicates.
* 10% of the prize pot is reserved for Low Severity or informational findings. These reports are judged based on quality and researchers are then ranked from 1st to 5th for the purpose of prize allocation:  
   * 1st: $2.5k  
   * 2nd: $1.25k  
   * 3rd: $600  
   * 4th: $400  
   * 5th: $250

### Superform - ctf

Judging

# Superform CTF

Hack Superform, keep the money.

* Add your wallet address to your profile (Profile -> Edit Profile -> CTF Addresses).
* The contracts are live, you can (legally) hack it onchain.
* Use cantina code interface to submit a writeup about the exploit, with a link to etherscan / equivalent.
* There is no judging. No severity disputes. No PoC. Just hacking!

## Planting The Flags

Starting December 28th, the Superform Protocol will be deployed on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Deposits will be made into 3 vaults on each chain for a total of 9 vaults. Deposits will be made into 3 vaults daily in tranches of $2.5k at 15:00 UTC until all deposits have been made.

The goal is to steal the ERC4626 shares held in Superform Protocol’s Superform contracts and tokens in transit from chain to chain. If stolen, the security researcher can keep the bounty in the vault. Users may do this via any protocol action — creating new Superforms, depositing/withdrawing from the protocol into vaults themselves via our contracts, etc.

* [Superform Addresses with Deposits](https://docs.superform.xyz/resources/ctf-competition-deposit-addresses)

### Morpho - metamorpho-and-periphery

Escalations

# Metamorpho and Periphery Competition

Morpho Labs has teamed up with Cantina for the inaugural public security review competition hosted on their new platform by security researchers for security researchers.

The competition at a glance:

* November 16th 10:00 UTC to December 7th 10:00 UTC
* $100k total prize pool.

### What is Morpho Blue and MetaMorpho

Morpho Blue and MetaMorpho form part of the vision to rebuild decentralized lending in layers, with MetaMorpho enabling any lending experience to be rebuilt on a shared and immutable base layer: Morpho Blue.

Morpho Blue is a trustless lending primitive that offers unparalleled efficiency and flexibility. It enables the creation of isolated lending markets by specifying any loan asset, any collateral asset, a liquidation LTV (LLTV), an oracle, and an interest rate model.

MetaMorpho is a protocol for lending vaults built on Morpho Blue. Anyone can create a vault that allocates to multiple Morpho Blue markets. Each vault is curated to provide suppliers with tailored risk exposures, better yields, and greater transparency.

Visit the [docs](https://www.notion.so/00ff8194791045deb522821be46abbdc?pvs=21) for a complete project overview.

### Prize distribution and scoring

The prize distribution works as follows:

* Security reviewers will score points for each finding.
* Prizes are distributed proportionally to the number of points scored.
* A High Severity is worth 10 points, and a Medium Severity 3 points.
* Duplicate findings will be resolved using a scoring formula that incentivizes unique findings.
* Duplicate findings will be resolved using the following scoring formula that incentivizes unique findings:  
   * Each duplicate finding will be scaled down by 0.9n−1/n0.9^{n - 1} / n0.9n−1/n, where nnn is the # of duplicates.
* 10% of the prize pot is reserved for Low Severity or informational findings. These reports are judged based on quality and researchers are then ranked from 1st to 5th for the purpose of prize allocation:  
   * 1st: $5k  
   * 2nd: $2.5k  
   * 3rd: $1.25k  
   * 4th: $625  
   * 5th: $625
